  <p>Damascus (Arabic: دمشق‎ Dimashq [diˈmaʃq], Syrian: [dˈməʃe(ː)ʔ]) is the capital and likely the largest city of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the battle for the city. It is commonly known in Syria as ash-Sham (Arabic: الشام‎ ash-Shām) and nicknamed as the City of Jasmine (Arabic: مدينة الياسمين‎ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,[4] Damascus is a major cultural centre of the Levant and the Arab world. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 as of 2009.[3]

Located in south-western Syria, Damascus is the centre of a large metropolitan area of 2.6 million people (2004).[5] Geographically embedded on the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea level. The Barada River flows through Damascus.

First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. Damascus saw a political decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. Today, it is the seat of the central government and all of the government ministries.  </p>

  <h3 id="hsites"> Historical sites </h3>
  <!--source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus#Culture -->
  <p>Damascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to 2.4 m (8 ft) below the modern level.[citation needed] The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The Damascus Straight Street (referred to in the account of the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the Via Recta, was the decumanus (East-West main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate). Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within a walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is located.</p>
    
    <p><strong> Walls and gates of Damascus: </strong>
  The Old City of Damascus with an approximate area of 86.12 hectares[93] is surrounded by ramparts on the northern and eastern sides and part of the southern side. There are seven extant city gates, the oldest of which dates back to the Roman period. These are, clockwise from the north of the citadel: <ul> 
  <li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Bab_Sharqi%2C_Damascus.jpg"target="_blank"><span>Bab al-Faradis</span> </a> ("the gate of the orchards", or "of the paradise")</li>
      <li><a href="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/87870899.jpg"target="_blank"> <span>Bab al-Salam</span> </a>("the gate of peace"), all on the north boundary of the Old City</li>    
      <li><a href="http://www.lovedamascus.com/fls/pp/305/phts/J_id_aPjff_FnY.jpg" target="_blank"> <span>Bab Tuma</span> </a>("Touma" or "Thomas's Gate") in the north-east corner, leading into the Christian quarter of the same name</li>
      <li><a href="https://refugeeoflove.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/babsharki_foto.jpg?w=620"target="_blank"><span>Bab Sharqi</span> </a>("eastern gate") in the east wall, the only one to retain its Roman plan</li>
      <li><a href="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/59074637.jpg"target="_blank"> <span>Bab Kisan</span> </a>in the south-east, from which tradition holds that Saint Paul made his escape from Damascus, lowered from the ramparts in a basket; this gate has been closed and turned into Chapel of Saint Paul marking this event</li>
  <li> <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Bab_al-Saghir.JPG"target="_blank"><span>Bab al-Saghir </span></a>(The Small Gate) </li>
  <li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Bab_Qinnasrin2010.jpg/800px-Bab_Qinnasrin2010.jpg"target="_blank"> <span>Bab al-Jabiya </span></a>at the entrance to Souk Midhat Pasha, in the south-west.  </li>
  
    </ul>
  Other areas outside the walled city also bear the name "gate": Bab al-Faraj, Bab Mousalla and Bab Sreija, both to the south-west of the walled city.
